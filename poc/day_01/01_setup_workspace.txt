Applying project template app for python

# Welcome to your CDK Python project!

This is a blank project for CDK development with Python.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!

NOTICES         (What's this? https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/wiki/CLI-Notices)

34892   CDK CLI collects telemetry data on command usage starting at version 2.1100.0 (unless opted out)

        Overview: We do not collect customer content and we anonymize the
                  telemetry we do collect. See the attached issue for more
                  information on what data is collected, why, and how to
                  opt-out. Telemetry will NOT be collected for any CDK CLI
                  version prior to version 2.1100.0 - regardless of
                  opt-in/out. You can also view the telemetry we collect by
                  logging it to a local file, by adding
                  `--telemetry-file=my/local/file` to any `cdk` command.

        Affected versions: cli: ^2.1100.0

If you don’t want to see a notice anymore, use "cdk acknowledge <id>". For example, "cdk acknowledge 34892".
