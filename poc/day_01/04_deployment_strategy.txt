2. The Deployment Strategy
Process: sam deploy --guided While the core infra is CDK, often platform teams use SAM (Serverless Application Model) for local testing or specialized Lambda deployments. For your interview, highlight that you understand both.

The samconfig.toml (Generated after first guided deploy):

Ini, TOML

version = 0.1
[default.deploy.parameters]
stack_name = "lifeproof-ai-worker"
s3_bucket = "aws-sam-cli-managed-default-samclisourcebucket"
region = "us-east-1"
confirm_changeset = true
capabilities = "CAPABILITY_IAM"
parameter_overrides = "ModelId=\"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\""
Interview Tip: If asked why use SAM over CDK, say: "SAM is excellent for local Lambda debugging and rapid API prototyping, while CDK is my choice for complex, multi-service Object-Oriented infrastructure."
